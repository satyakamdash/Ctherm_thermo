Notes from call with Satya 12-20-2018

Topics:
1. General discussion
 * Are ATP ratios different from GTP ratios? - No

1. Relative ranking of different flux sets
2. Malate shunt differences

Path forward:
1. Choose dataset - use dataset 2
2. Which metabolites to exclude
   Definitely exclude
     ATP/ADP/AMP - fix ATP/ADP ratio at 30
     GTP/GDP/GMP - fix GTP/GDP ratio at 30
     Cellobiose - peak is ok, but we should set this to 10 mM for all runs
     NAD/NADH ratio - ratio can vary from 1 to 100
     NADPH/NADP ratio - ratio can vary from 1 to 100
     
   Might be okay
     Acetyl-CoA
     3PG
     CoA
     Malate
     
   Good
     DHAP - need to re-analyze with correct RT
     GAP - need to re-analyze with correct RT
     FBP
     F6P
     Glucose
     G1P
     G6P
     PEP
     Pyr
     
3. Run sensitivity analysis
- Has the potential to identify "bad" metabolites
- Could show which metabolite is constraining the MDF

Key findings using metabolite data:
* run 2 flux sets (ppi-pfk and ppi-pfk + malate shunt). Need to balance stoichiometry of model when we add malate shunt. (Dan will adjust model stoichiometry)
* Is exsisting metabolite data thermodynamically consistent? (sensitivity analysis could help here)
* Might be able to identify a regulation event
* Show that the change in metabolites is consistent with what we would expect from metabolism being limited by thermodynamic equilibrium at the ppi-pfk reaction
* Answer question of why ethanol production stops. Evaluate these hypotheses:
  a) ethanol inhibits a single enzyme (i.e. regulatory event)
  b) ethanol causes thermodynamic limitation
  c) ethanol causes loss of membrane integrity (maybe we can't do this with the current method)
* also run T. sacch data set. We should see a higher MDF.
     
Key findings from model structure (no metabolite data needed):
* PPi ratio is very important for system. This is a high priority to measure for the next set of experiments (i.e. next paper), whereas, ATP and GTP ratios don't matter as much
* Overall effect of various individual interventions (from best to worst, show by plotting MDF vs. ethanol concentration). 
  - replace ppdk with malate shunt (and associated reactions)
  - replace gapDH with gapN
  - switch adh from NADH to NADPH
  - switch aldh from NADH to NADPH
  - replace pfor and aldh with pdc
  - replace ppi-pfk with atp-pfk
  - replace ppdk with pyk
  - beta-glucosidase vs. cellobiose phosphorylase
* Compare to T. sacch pathway (collection of several interventions)
* Comprehensive set of interventions
 - determine all EFMs 
 - ***run through thermodynamic model, determine MDF at 1M ethanol***
 - plot MDF vs. net ATP generation (need to make assumption about PPi to ATP conversion) at 1M ethanol
 
 
Action items for Dan:
- fix DHAP and G3P data
- get notebook set up to read model data
- improve dashboard

Satya list:
- generate EFMs with balanced NADH and NADPH cofactors, also balance GTP and ATP 
ATP = GTP
ATP + AMP = 2 ADP
- all net reactions have only cellobiose, ethanol, pi, ppi, ATP, ADP
- do sensitivity analysis (waiting on DHAP and G3P data)
- final plot of MDF vs. EFMs at 1M ethanol
